Instructions for SSHing scripts

- Download the zip file.
- Right click on the file and extract to your C drive. The file you are sending it to should be "C:\Users\<firstname>.<lastname>
- Once you have extracted all the documents, open your command line and make sure that your directory is "C:\Users\<firstname>.<lastname>
- If this is your first time, run "wsl_download.bat" by typing "wsl_download.bat" into the command line and hit enter
- then run "wsl_startup.bat" and hit enter
- The rest is automated with limited user input.
